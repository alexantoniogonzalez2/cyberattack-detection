## Cyberattack Detection
Machine learning based cyberattack detection in network traffic.

## Context
- This works is part of the subject Security Analytics, 2020 Semester 2, The University of Melbourne.
- It was a personal assessment (no group project).

## Files
- Please take a look to [this report](https://github.com/alexantoniogonzalez2/cyberattack_detection/blob/master/COMP90073%20-%20Assignment%202%20-%20Alex%20Gonza%CC%81lez.pdf).

## Main characteristics
The tasks of this project were:
- To apply unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection.
- to use gradient descent-based method to generate adversarial samples against supervised learning models 

## Structure
- This project works with the folder ml-data included in this delivery. In this folder, inside the subfolder 1_raw_data should be put the files necessary for the project.
- Inside the main cyberattack_detection folder there is several subfolder with the different files referenced in the report. This executables should work properly with the structure of ml-data.
- The requested output file are available in the folder 5 selected output

## Requirements
- Environment for run a Jupyter Notebook. For example: [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/install). A basic requirement for Jupyter Notebook is Python.   
- The data files utilized in this project should be in a folder named 'data' in the same directory that the file 'Neural Network for movie genre prediction.ipynb'.

## Compatibility
The libraries needed in this project are specified in the Jupyter Notebook. The most general libraries utilized are:
- Python: 3.8
